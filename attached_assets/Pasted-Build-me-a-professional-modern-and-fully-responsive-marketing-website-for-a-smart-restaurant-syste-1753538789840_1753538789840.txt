Build me a professional, modern, and fully responsive marketing website for a smart restaurant system called Runix. The website must support both English and Swedish, and the user should be able to toggle between the two languages. Use clean layout, professional typography, smooth animations, and mobile-friendly design. I want a full structure that includes a homepage, features, testimonials, customization info, pricing, FAQs, and footer.

Here's the full structure and content (in both English and Swedish):

🏠 Homepage (Hero Section)
Large centered hero box with:

EN: "The Smartest Way to Run Your Restaurant"
SV: "Det smartaste sättet att driva din restaurang"

Smaller subheading:
EN: "Runix is a smart, all-in-one system that helps restaurants take orders faster, serve better, and sell more with less stress for your staff."
SV: "Runix är ett smart, allt-i-ett-system som hjälper restauranger att ta emot beställningar snabbare, ge bättre service och sälja mer — med mindre stress för personalen."

On the right side of the hero box: embed a placeholder for a YouTube video (demo will be added later)

Below hero: professional logo carousel (scrolling horizontally, autoplay, placeholder logos)

🚀 Why Runix (Features Section)
Each item should be inside a box with an icon, headline, text, and a placeholder image on the side.

🧾 Take more orders, faster
EN: No more waiting to place an order. Tables turn faster. Customers are happier.
SV: Inga fler väntetider för beställningar. Borden vänder snabbare. Kunderna blir nöjdare.

⭐ Get more Google reviews
EN: After the meal, guests get a text asking for a review — fully automated.
SV: Efter måltiden får gästerna ett sms som ber om en recension — helt automatiserat.

💬 Bring guests back automatically
EN: Send offers by SMS to past customers with just a few clicks.
SV: Skicka erbjudanden via SMS till tidigare kunder med bara några klick.

💰 Sell more with smart upsells
EN: Runix suggests drinks, sides, or desserts during checkout — most guests say yes.
SV: Runix föreslår drycker, tillbehör eller desserter vid utcheckning — de flesta tackar ja.

🧠 Track everything in real time
EN: Know what’s going on in your restaurant at any moment — even if you’re not there.
SV: Få full överblick i realtid — även när du inte är på plats.

🧑‍🍳 Make life easier for your staff
EN: No more running back and forth. No more missed orders.
SV: Ingen mer spring. Inga fler missade beställningar.

🎨 Customization Section
Title suggestion: “Made for Your Brand” / “Skräddarsytt för ditt varumärke”

Text:

EN: Everything in Runix can be customized:

SV: Allt i Runix kan anpassas:

Bullet points:

Your logo / Din logotyp

Your colors / Dina färger

Your menu and layout / Din meny och layout

Any language / Vilket språk du vill

Flow of how guests order / Gästens beställningsflöde

Final sentence:

EN: You decide how it works — we just make it easy.

SV: Du bestämmer hur det fungerar — vi gör det enkelt.

👥 Testimonials Section
Title: What Other Restaurant Owners Say / Vad Andra Restaurangägare Säger

Use quote cards with names and cities:

💸 Pricing Page
Title: Pricing / Priser
Add 3 pricing plans with placeholders (Basic, Pro, Enterprise). Show monthly pricing, features included, and CTA button for each.

❓ FAQ Section
Title: Frequently Asked Questions / Vanliga Frågor
Add 5 collapsible question-answer items in both languages (placeholder questions I will change later).

📞 Support Section
Title: Support That Actually Supports You / Stöd som faktiskt stöttar dig

🔻 Footer
Add Runix logo

Language switcher (EN / SV)

Navigation links: Home, Why Runix, Customization, Pricing, FAQ, Contact

Social media icons (placeholders)

Clean and minimal layout

Use modern fonts (like Inter, Poppins, or DM Sans), add scroll animations, and ensure mobile responsiveness. Design should be premium and scalable — suitable for a tech startup SaaS product.
